            <h3>Tree Plantation</h3>
            <p>
                Tree plays a significant role for all of us as well as for animals, insects, birds etc. As we know the
                famous phrase “Save trees, Save life”. So, we acknowledge it and be a part of the plantation.
                <ul>
                    <li>Trees are important for life on Earth. Trees give us shade. Trees give beauty to any place. Trees bear
                        beautiful and colourful flowers.</li>
                    <li>Trees are home to many animals, birds and insects. When trees are cut, these creatures lose their home.</li>
                    <li>Trees are also food for man, and all herbivorous animals and birds. Insects also depend on trees to
                            complete their life cycle.</li>
                </ul>
                <q>The best time to plant a tree is twenty years ago. The second best time is now.</q>
